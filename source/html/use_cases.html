					<p>Meet Kim Cooke, Adobe Strategy Enablement Manager. When she first reviewed the badging process consisting of new hires standing in long lines to provide a paper signature, and the office staff manually filing hundreds of forms, she knew there had to be a better way. Her research and probing led her to Adobe Sign. Through a few simple steps, Kim was able to transform the manual ID intake process into a digital one. Now, with Adobe Sign, new employees e-sign consent forms, and can obtain their badge on day 1, without ever having to enter the Photo ID offices or wait in line. Likewise, Photo ID staff experienced a 50% reduction in email traffic, and are now able to quickly access filed documents, provide easy reporting, and have saved a total of 9,956 pages of paper over the last year.</p>

					<p>In 2017, Ty Lagerberg, Adobe Global Safety & Security Area Manager, wanted to digitize signature collection for carpool/vanpool signups in the Lehi office. At that time, carpool volunteers had to physically obtain signatures from all the carpool participants. The process was cumbersome, and, often, was not completed correctly. The result was a back and forth between the offices and carpool applicants. At Summit that year, Ty came across the Sign team, who helped him create a sequential process for routing signatures to multiple participants. Today, employees can quickly and easily email the carpool form to every signer, including submitting the form to Ty for final approval. Additionally, the security office no longer has to scan and input each document because they automatically receive an electronic copy that they can later reference to search for and verify license plates. All made possible with Adobe Sign.</p>

					<p>Depending on the purchase, contracts were passing through 4 different desks for approval. To complicate matters, some departments had to sign twice: once to approve spend, and then later to review and approve contract terms. To transform their operations, procurement worked with the legal department to consolidate the contract and legal approval process. The combination of process improvement and integration of Adobe Sign resulted in a total contract cycle reduction of 73%. Using Adobe Sign, procurement team members can easily upload contract templates from a shared drive and add signature fields. By switching from ink signatures to electronic documents, procurement has reduced its consumption of paper and printing supplies by more than 80%.</p>
