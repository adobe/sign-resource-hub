## Goals

It's critical to enable an organization's users to fully leverage tools available.  This is a turnkey resource hub that is designed to be hosted on client systems.

### Installation

This codebase is currently dependent on Prepros & should work out of the box.  It's also supposed to work with CodeKit, but I have not tested that yet.

If you are going to modify this site, do so in the `source` dir.

To deploy, there is a flat HTML site in the `publish` dir.
